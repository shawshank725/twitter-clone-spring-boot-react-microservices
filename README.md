## üìú Algorithms & Flows

### üîπ Timeline Generation
1. Connection service returns a list of followers & followees (given a user id).  
2. Deduplicate into a **set**.  
3. Another endpoint fetches **post IDs** for this set.  
4. Send post IDs to frontend ‚Üí frontend maps & displays posts.  
5. Show first 10 posts ‚Üí then "Show more" appends 10 more.  
6. If <10 posts ‚Üí display global feed.  

### üîπ Suggested People to Follow
1. Get list of users the logged-in user already follows.  
2. Fetch all users (excluding self).  
3. Compute: `All users ‚Äì Followed users = Not Followed`.  
4. Display max 4 at a time in frontend (React Query).  
5. Once a user is followed, remove from list & replace with next.  

### üîπ Settings Page Includes
- Change username  
- Change password  
- Delete account  

üîπ **Change Username**  
- Check backend if new username is already taken.
