# Twitter Clone Backend & Frontend

> **✅ Status:** This project is now **complete**. All planned features have been implemented.

This is a **microservices-based Twitter clone** built with **Spring Boot**, **Java**, **React**, **HashiCorp Consul** for service discovery, and **NeonDB (PostgreSQL)** as the database.  
It supports real-time interactions using **WebSockets** (for notifications) and includes advanced features like image cropping, open-feign clients, MySQL triggers (initially), and a fully functional timeline system.

## 🚀 Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Spring Boot (Java), OpenFeign, WebSockets, MySQL triggers (for some logic)
- **Frontend**: React, Vite, TanStack Query, React Easy Crop
- **Service Discovery**: HashiCorp Consul
- **Database**: NeonDB (PostgreSQL)

## 📜 Algorithms & Flows

### 🔹 Timeline Generation
1. Connection service returns a list of followers & followees (given a user id).  
2. Deduplicate into a **set**.  
3. Another endpoint fetches **post IDs** for this set.  
4. Send post IDs to frontend → frontend maps & displays posts.  
5. Show first 10 posts → then "Show more" appends 10 more.  
6. If <10 posts → display global feed.  

### 🔹 Suggested People to Follow
1. Get list of users the logged-in user already follows.  
2. Fetch all users (excluding self).  
3. Compute: `All users – Followed users = Not Followed`.  
4. Display max 4 at a time in frontend (React Query).  
5. Once a user is followed, remove from list & replace with next.  

### 🔹 Settings Page Includes
- Change username  
- Change password  
- Delete account  

🔹 **Change Username**  
- Check backend if new username is already taken.  
- Show ✅ (green tick) if available, ❌ (red cross) if not.  
- Backend endpoint validates & updates.
